# Data-Driven-Optimization-of-Football-Squad-Recruitment
This study introduces a comprehensive optimization
framework designed to enhance football squad recruitment
through strategic, data-driven player acquisition. The proposed
model utilizes detailed performance statistics, engineered contri-
bution features, and tactical analyses of team-level requirements
to inform effective transfer decisions. Driven by the increasing
reliance on analytics within modern football management, this
research addresses the complex challenge of recruiting players
who not only excel individually but also precisely address the
specific tactical needs of the squad. The framework initially
identifies a tailored pool of suitable players who align closely
with the teamâ€™s identified needs. It then systematically evaluates
tactical gaps, pinpointing the roles that require reinforcement or
are entirely lacking. Finally, an optimization model selects the
optimal combination of players from this refined pool, ensuring
alignment with tactical priorities, adherence to budget con-
straints, and effective mitigation of identified squad weaknesses.
